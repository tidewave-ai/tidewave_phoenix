# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2025-08-19)

* Enhancements
  * Improve the experience if using outdated `phoenix_live_reload`
  * Improve the experience if Tidewave is plugged too late
  * Improve results for `search_package_docs` tool
  * Use new streamable HTTP MCP protocol

* Backwards incompatible changes
  * Previously deprecated file system tools have been removed

Important: if you previously configured your editor using the SSE transport instead of using a proxy, you likely need to reconfigure the MCP connection using "HTTP" or "Streamable HTTP" instead.

## 0.3.2 (2025-08-13)

* Bug fix
  * Fix shell endpoint on Windows

## 0.3.1 (2025-08-13)

* Enhancements
  * Improve error messages when peer or origin is not allowed

## 0.3.0 (2025-08-05)

  * Warn if `git` is not present
  * Support umbrella apps on Ecto tools
  * Support for upcoming Tidewave Web

* Deprecations
  * `?include_fs_tools=true` is deprecated as well as support for Claude Desktop in favor of any other editor or CLI that ships with built-in filesystem tools

## 0.2.0 (2025-07-11)

This release removes the `get_process_info` and `trace_process` tools. If you happened to use those a lot in the past, consider writing an AGENTS.md (or similar) instructions file to explain to your agent that it can do the same using `project_eval` and providing Elixir code. In Elixir 1.18.4+, there's also the `IEx.Helpers.process_info/1` function which does the same as `get_process_info`.

Furthermore, we also removed `package_search` because it turned out to not be that useful. `package_docs_search` was renamed to `search_package_docs`.

If you used the file system tools (which are only useful for Claude Desktop that does not provide file system integration by itself), we also removed the dedicated `grep_project_files` tool in favor of calling `git grep` (or similar) using `shell_eval`.

* Enhancements
  * Add `level` parameter to logs tool to specify a minimum log level
  * Add dedicated `get_docs` tool

* Removals
  * `get_process_info` and `trace_process` were removed in favor of `project_eval`
  * `grep_project_files` was removed in favor of `shell_eval`
