# Tidewave

Tidewave is the coding agent for full-stack web app development, deeply integrated with Phoenix, from the database to the UI. [See our website](https://tidewave.ai) for more information.

This project can also be used as a standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for your editors.

## Installation

### Manually

You can install Tidewave by adding the `tidewave` package to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tidewave, "~> 0.5", only: :dev}
  ]
end
```

Then, for Phoenix applications, go to your `lib/my_app_web/endpoint.ex` and right above the `if code_reloading? do` block, add:

```diff
+  if Code.ensure_loaded?(Tidewave) do
+    plug Tidewave
+  end

   if code_reloading? do
```

Now access `/tidewave` route of your web application to enjoy Tidewave Web!

> Tidewave Web works best with Phoenix LiveView v1.1 or later. Once you update it,
> make sure to enable the following options in your `config/dev.exs`:
>
> ```elixir
> config :phoenix_live_view,
>   debug_heex_annotations: true,
>   debug_attributes: true
> ```
>
> Those are enabled by default for Phoenix v1.8+ apps.

> If you are running an umbrella project, also add this to your  `config/runtime.exs`:
>
> ```elixir
> config :tidewave, :root, File.cwd!()
> ```

### Using Igniter

Alternatively, you can use `igniter` to automatically install it into an existing Phoenix application:

```sh
# install igniter_new if you haven't already
mix archive.install hex igniter_new

# install tidewave
mix igniter.install tidewave
```

Now access `/tidewave` route of your web application to enjoy Tidewave Web!

### Usage in non-Phoenix applications

Tidewave can be used as a MCP in any Elixir project. For example, you can use `bandit` (and `tidewave`) in dev mode in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
{:tidewave, "~> 0.4", only: :dev},
{:bandit, "~> 1.0", only: :dev},
```

And then adding an alias in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
aliases: [
  tidewave:
    "run --no-halt -e 'Agent.start(fn -> Bandit.start_link(plug: Tidewave, port: 4000) end)'"
]
```

Now run `mix tidewave` and [configure Tidewave as a MCP](https://hexdocs.pm/tidewave/mcp.html).

## Troubleshooting

Tidewave expects your web application to be running on `localhost`. If you are not running on localhost, you may need to set some additional configuration. In particular, you must pass `allow_remote_access: true` to `plug Tidewave` and optionally configure the origin you are accessing from, for example:

```elixir
  plug Tidewave,
   allow_remote_access: true,
   allowed_origins: ["http://company.local"]
```

If you want to use Docker for development, you either need to enable the configuration above or automatically redirect the relevant ports, as done by [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). See our [containers](https://hexdocs.pm/tidewave/containers.html) guide for more information.

### Content security policy

If you have enabled Content-Security-Policy, Tidewave will automatically enable "unsafe-eval" under `script-src` in order for contextual browser testing to work correctly. It also disables the `frame-ancestors` directive.

## Configuration

You may configure the `Tidewave` plug using the following syntax:

```elixir
  plug Tidewave, options
```

The following options are available:

  * `:allowed_origins` - a list of values matched against the `Origin` header to prevent cross origin and DNS rebinding attacks. Each value must be a string of shape `[scheme:]//host[:port]`, where both scheme and port are optional. The host may also start with "*". Example: `["//localhost:8000", "//*.test"]`.

  * `:allow_remote_access` - Tidewave only allows requests from localhost by default, even if your server listens on other interfaces as well. If you trust your network and need to access Tidewave from a different machine, this configuration can be set to `true`.

  * `:inspect_opts` - Custom options passed to `Kernel.inspect/2` when formatting some tool results. Defaults to: `[charlists: :as_lists, limit: 50, pretty: true]`

  * `:team` - set your Tidewave Team configuration, such as `team: [id: "my-company"]`

Furthermore, the following options are available in the `:tidewave` application and can configured in your `config/runtime.exs`:

  * `:root` - The root of your application. It defaults to the current working directory but you may set it to a root directory, in case of monorepos and umbrella projects. For example, you may set it to `config :tidewave, :root, File.cwd!()` in the `config/runtime.exs` file of your umbrella root so Tidewave sees your whole project, even when started within a child application. Keep in mind the `:root` directory must always be version managed by `Git`
