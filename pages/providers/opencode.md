# OpenCode

You can connect Tidewave Web directly to [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). 

Simply open up Tidewave Web settings, choose the Providers tab, choose "OpenCode" and click "Connect". Next we will automatically download and install OpenCode for you.

Once connected, we will automatically configure OpenCode to also use Tidewave MCP. You may disable this option if (and only if) you have already customized Codex to use Tidewave MCP.
