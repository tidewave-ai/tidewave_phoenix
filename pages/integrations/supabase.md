# Supabase

Tidewave Web supports direct integration with local Supabase instances, with two features:

* Inspect performance and security advisors as part of Tidewave diagnostics and optionally forward them to your coding agent

* Use your local Supabase instance as a MCP server in your coding sessions

## Configuration

To enable this feature, you will need to:

1. Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started)
2. Run your database with `supabase start`

Now you are ready to connect Tidewave to your database under Settings, as shown in the video above.
