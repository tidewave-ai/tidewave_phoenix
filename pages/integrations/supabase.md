# Supabase

Tidewave Web supports direct integration with local Supabase instances. At the moment, you can use our Supabase integration to fetch performance and security advisors, and forward them to your coding agent. We are also actively working on connecting to your local Supabase instance as a MCP, which will be announced soon. Stay tuned!

## Configuration

To enable this feature, you will need to:

1. Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started)
2. Run your database with `supabase start`

Now you are ready to connect Tidewave to your database under Settings.
