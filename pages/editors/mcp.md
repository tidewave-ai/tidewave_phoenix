# MCP

You can integrate Tidewave into any editor or AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We have tailored instructions for some of them:

  * [Claude Code](claude_code.md)
  * [Claude Desktop](claude.md)
  * [Cursor](cursor.md)
  * [Neovim](neovim.md)
  * [opencode](opencode.md)
  * [VS Code](vscode.md)
  * [Windsurf](windsurf.md)
  * [Zed](zed.md)

## General instructions

For any other editor/assistant, you need to include Tidewave as MCP of type "sse", pointing to the `/tidewave/mcp` path of port your web application is running on. For example, `http://localhost:4000/tidewave/mcp`.

In case your tool of choice does not support "sse" servers, only "io" ones, you can use one of the many available [MCP proxies](../guides/mcp_proxy.md).

## Available tools

Here is a baseline comparison of the tools supported by different frameworks/languages. Frameworks may support additional features.
