# Claude

You can use Tidewave with Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

## Claude Desktop

To use Tidewave with Claude Desktop, you must first install
a [`mcp-proxy`](../guides/mcp_proxy.md).

Then open up Claude Desktop, go to "Settings" and, under the
"Developer" tab, click on "Edit Config". It will point to a file
you can open in your favorite editor. Which you must edit to
include the following settings, depending on the proxy:

### Python Proxy

On macos/Linux:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp?include_fs_tools=true"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-proxy.exe",
      "args": ["http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp?include_fs_tools=true"]
    }
  }
}
```

Where `$PORT` is the port your web application is running on.

### Elixir Proxy

On macos/Linux:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "command": "/path/to/escript",
      "args": [
        "$HOME/.mix/escripts/mcp-proxy",
        "http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp?include_fs_tools=true"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tidewave": {
      "command": "escript.exe",
      "args": [
        "$HOME/.mix/escripts/mcp-proxy",
        "http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp?include_fs_tools=true"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Where you replace `$HOME` by your home folder (shown during installation)
and `$PORT` by the port your web application is running on.

And you are good to go! Note we enabled filesystem tools by default,
as Claude Desktop does not support any filesystem operation out of the box.
If your application uses a SQL database, you can verify it all works
by asking it to run `SELECT 1` as database query. If it fails,
check out [our Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

## Claude Code

Adding Tidewave to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
is straight-forward, just run:

```shell
$ claude mcp add --transport sse tidewave http://localhost:$PORT/tidewave/mcp
```

Where `$PORT` is the port your web application is running on. And you are good to go!
