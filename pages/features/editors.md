# Editor integration

Tidewave can open up files and page elements directly in your editor.

Whenever Tidewave renders a file location, you can directly click the filename to open it in your editor. They will be identified with an upward right facing arrow (â†—):

<img src="assets/file-editor.png" alt="File editor integration" width="400px">

When you click the filename for the first time, Tidewave will open up the "Editor integration" pane on Settings, where you can choose between a few preset editors, or set up a custom URL or a custom command.

You can also use our editor integration alongside the [Inspector](inspector.md). Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click (macOS) an element with the Inspector enabled will automatically open it in your editor.
