# Teams

The Tidewave Team plan provides a central place to manage billing and configuration. Currently in beta, this plan offers early adopters special pricing and the opportunity to shape our roadmap.

[You can create and manage your teams on Tidewave](https://tidewave.ai/teams). Then configure your project to use your Tidewave Team settings. This gives all developers in your project the opportunity to leverage Tidewave's full-stack agentic coding capabilities.

## Configuration

Applications that use Tidewave Team must be explicitly configured to do so. Once you create your team, you can find the "Installation" steps for your preferred framework in your Team page.

Note the Tidewave Team plan is separate from your Tidewave Pro account. You don't need a Tidewave Pro account if your project is configured to use the Tidewave Team plan.

## Invitations

You can create invitation links in your Team page and share them with your team members. By clicking the link, they may request to join the team. Team admins will be notified of every request, which must then be explicitly approved.

Team invitations can also be given as `token` in your Tidewave configuration. This allows your colleagues to request to join the team when they first open Tidewave Web.
